<!-- The img has a compulsory src attribute that needs to have a value of the location of the image  

Save the images in the same file as the html one. Make sure that your image names end with ".jpg". Then 
in the top write <img src = "image name"/>.

<!-- the alt is used for readers who cannot access the images because of their size. -->
